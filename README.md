# Distributed Graph Processing - TLAV-Pregel
Project of Semantic Data Management (SDM) Course for the Master in Data Science Program of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)

***

This repository is focused on exploring distributed-graph processing libraries such as GraphX’s Pregel API[^1], as well as introducing Spark Graph Frames[^2].

GraphX is a component of Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation, providing a collection of graph algorithms (e.g., Page Rank, Triangle Counting and Connected Components) and some fundamental operations on graphs based on Think Like A Vertex (TLAV) technique.

The structure of this repository follows the structure presented below:
* **Exercise 1**: Getting familiar with GraphX's Pregel API
* **Exercise 2**: Computing shortest paths using Pregel
* **Exercise 3**: Extending shortest path's computation
* **Exercise 4**: Spark Graph Frames
